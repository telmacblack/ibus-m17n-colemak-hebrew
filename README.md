# ibus-m17n-colemak-hebrew
An ibus-m17n hebrew layout for colemak users
## Layout ##
All nikudot are included besides the chataf forms, incuding the rafe; ligatures for yiddish are also included. The nikudot are all combining characters. Those mappings which have only their normal qwerty mappings are not defined. This layout was created for my own use and likely no one will find it intelligible or useful, therefore do not be surprised if you dislike it.

The layout for ibus-m17n is against a standard US keyboard, but the hebrew:latin mappings are relative to colmak.
